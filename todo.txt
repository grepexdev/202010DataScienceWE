Matt Wright - Data Science Course Divergence 
Something you learned last weekend
	I learned what I might want to do for the possible Capstone Project. Played in the SQL tutorial

What you want to learn most this weekend
	I am not really into this, and it is not what I want to do. Just want to make it through the course so I can learn more Python and SQL

What you hope to do for capstone prep this weekend 1.
	Find out if I am even doing a capstone project after the post this morning... Will have to build an excell file as my data is not downloadable.
