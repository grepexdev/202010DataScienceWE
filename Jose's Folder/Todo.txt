1. I learned that accuracy is not always the best indicator of performance for a model. Also Azure ML was new to me and it was nice to see things like that exist.

2. It was nice to have all the model algorithms automated in Azure, but it would be cool to build one or some in Python. 

3.For capstone prep, the plan is to transfer code from R to Python. Since the majority of packages used dont exist in Python, we will have to find alternatives to making the code work.
