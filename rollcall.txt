Jason: 585f4b70-2976-48df-93ce-c4af2d163ba4, SP500 Text Classification. Solid stats refresher. Went over AzureML interface which was nice. Similar to what Greg mentioned, as well
as discovered in class, AzureML is nice to have given low code/no code but slow to run. Excited to see it all connecting though.
