Today one of my main takeaways was the different types of learning. I had already been familiar with supervised and unsupervised. 
Batched learning, online learning, offline learning, etc. were all new to me. I also got some familiarity with Azure ML, at first
glance it seems very slow, but it looks like it would be great for collaboration.

Jason: 585f4b70-2976-48df-93ce-c4af2d163ba4, SP500 Text Classification. Solid stats refresher. Went over AzureML interface which was nice. Similar to what Greg mentioned, as well
as discovered in class, AzureML is nice to have given low code/no code but slow to run. Excited to see it all connecting though.
