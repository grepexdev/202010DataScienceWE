1. Something I learned last weekend
Last weekend was good refresher for me on the machine learning process. The only new concept introduced to me was the use of 
Azure ML. I thought it was cool how the user does not need to know code to do machine learning, but I was not a fan of how slow the
system was. 

2. What I want to learn most this weekend
The thing I want to learn most this weekend is basically what we need to learn in order to pass the ML certification exams. 

3. What I hope to do for capstone prep this weekend
For my capstone prep, I hope to get started on piping my social media analysis from R over to Python. I'm not too familiar with 
webscraping and sentiment analysis on Python so I will have to do a little bit of research.
