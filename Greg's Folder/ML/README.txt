Today I learned a few different things. I leared about the thousands upon thousands of machine learning algorithms that exist. 
Before, I knew about several but I didn't know there were that many. Additionally, I learned about some different types of biases
that may be present in the data. I also learned about the different types of metrics that can be used to determine how well the model
works. I learned an interesting viewpoint that accuracy might not always be the best way to measure the performance of the model depending
on the cost/benefit values of the confusion matrix. Lastly, I learned that a threshold can be set to let the model know what the cutoff
is for classification.
