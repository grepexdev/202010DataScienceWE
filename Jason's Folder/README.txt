# Repository for Jason T

My goal at this point is to leverage Power Platform certifications for current career mobility. I'll probably just complete a MVP around BI since I'm also focused on
trying to build a Python foundation in preparation of a DS sponsorship following Divergence.

Since labor is typically the largest cost for organizations, I was thinking of doing an HR analytics piece focusing on predicting employee attrition. 

My initial thoughts for the flow would be:

-ETL dataset (.CSVs, https://www.kaggle.com/vjchoudhary7/hr-analytics-case-study)
-Classification via Azure ML
-PowerApp for employee engagement, but also generates additional user-inputs for future model tuning and KPIs
-Power Automate to bridge any gaps or automate any processes identified in the loop, maybe send alerts to HR or team leads for whatever reason
-Dashboard for HR teams

# I'm more focused on synching the platforms than build-outs, again MVP. Essentially, future use case would be to build a more robust model for 'fit'
using self-identified employee inputs, process automation for talent acquisitions, and automated dashboards for business leaders to gauge their teams.
The general framework can be translated across nearly any dataset where additional user-input/variables to explore could help boost the model. One instance could 
be medtech.
